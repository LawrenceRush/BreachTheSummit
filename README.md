# BreachTheSummit

Problem addressed - Breach the summit displays hikes near a searched location. User's confused about where hiking trailheads are located will not have to be any more.

App organization - The app is organized in a standard css, html, and javascript format. Html serves the website structure, the javascript handles the google map and other APIs, and the css handles website visuals and animations

Instructions - Simply enter a location into the search bar and see hikes near that location. Hit the x in the top corner of the info sidebar(it will pop in after the search) to do another search.
